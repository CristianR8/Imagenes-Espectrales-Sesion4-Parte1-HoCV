La variabilidad espectral puede estar causada por las condiciones ambientales (por ejemplo, variaciones en la iluminación), las condiciones atmosféricas (por ejemplo, agua en la atmósfera) y la variabilidad inherente dentro de un material.  La variabilidad inherente depende de la escala del miembro final considerado. Por ejemplo, si una especie vegetal concreta está asociada a un miembro final, la variación en este miembro final puede deberse a que el haz y el envés de las hojas de esa especie tienen firmas espectrales diferentes).  Los métodos de desmezcla espectral que tienen en cuenta la variabilidad espectral pueden clasificarse en dos categorías: enfoques basados en conjuntos y enfoques basados en la distribución.  Los enfoques basados en conjuntos representan un miembro final utilizando un conjunto discreto de espectros de miembros finales. Los enfoques basados en la distribución utilizan una distribución de probabilidad completa para representar un miembro final y su variabilidad asociada.  A menudo, los enfoques basados en conjuntos infrarrepresentan la variabilidad, mientras que los basados en la distribución pueden sobrerrepresentarla.

En general, los enfoques de detección de objetivos no son eficaces para estimar *cuánto* de un objetivo se encuentra dentro del campo de visión de un píxel (eso sería desmezclar) - sólo si el material está allí o no (con cierta confianza).  \n","\n","Los algoritmos de detección de objetivos hiperespectrales más utilizados son el *Spectral Matched Filter* (SMF) y el *Adaptive Cosine Estimator* (ACE).  Ambos métodos requieren tener de antemano la firma del blanco que se busca.  Ambos métodos estiman la confianza en el objetivo calculando el coseno del ángulo entre la firma del objetivo y un píxel de prueba en un espacio blanqueado (es decir, tras la normalización del fondo).  La principal diferencia entre ambos métodos es que el SMF tiene en cuenta la magnitud, mientras que el ACE no.  Se calculan del siguiente modo:\n","\n","\n","$SMF = \\frac{\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{s}-\\mu\\right)^T \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{x}-\\mu\\right)\\right)^2}{\\left(\\mathbf{s}-\\mu\\right)^T \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{s}-\\mu\\right)}$\n","\n","$ACE = \\frac{\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{s}-\\mu\\right)^T \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{x}-\\mu\\right)\\right)^2}{\\left(\\mathbf{s}-\\mu\\right)^T \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{s}-\\mu\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{x}-\\mu\\right)^T \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{x}-\\mu\\right)}$\n","\n","donde $\\mathbf{s}$ es la firma del objetivo, $\\mathbf{x}$ es el píxel bajo prueba, $\\mu$ es la media del fondo, y $\\Sigma$ es la covarianza del fondo.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CristianR8/spectral-images-session3/main/images/ACE.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\"/>\n","\n","**Estimación de la media y la covarianza del fondo**.  \n","A menudo resulta difícil determinar cómo estimar la media y la covarianza del fondo.  Si hay muy pocos objetivos en una escena, puede bastar con utilizar la media y la covarianza globales de la escena para representar el fondo.  También se ha trabajado para segmentar la escena y, a continuación, calcular las estadísticas del fondo para cada segmento.\n","\n","También hay enfoques en los que las estadísticas de fondo se calculan en un enfoque de \"ventana deslizante\" para centrarse sólo en la información local durante la estimación del fondo. El problema de estos métodos es determinar el tamaño de la ventana.  Si la ventana es demasiado pequeña, puede tener problemas para estimar las estadísticas de fondo de forma fiable.  Sin embargo, si la ventana es demasiado grande, ya no se utiliza sólo la información local.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fBZ52B458s4q"},"source":["El conjunto de datos MUUFL Gulfport incluye 64 objetivos emplazados que varían entre 0,25m^2$ y 3m^2$ de tamaño.

Por lo tanto, el tamaño de estos objetivos varía de superpíxel a subpíxel, y los más pequeños cubren como máximo un cuarto del campo de visión de un píxel (si están situados completamente dentro de ese píxel y no a caballo entre varios píxeles).
